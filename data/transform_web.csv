Stunning Ragdoll kittens,"Witham, Essex",700.0,Pets,,"* please note I am not receiving emails so please message or call mobile number provided *

I have a stunning litter of pure bred pedigree Ragdoll kittens including one boy and a girl ,

The kittens have been brought up in the heart of my home ( no nasty cages ) they roam free so they are very well socialised and are used to the hustle and bustle of a busy home including all house hold noises ect,

they have been handled from young by myself and my six year old daughter making them confident cuddly little beings to suit any family home.
They are healthy eating well litter box trained / scratch post trained/ upto date with all worming flea treatment ect.

I have their wonderful mum molly here for you to meet, she is our much loved family pet who has a extremely soft gentle nature which she has passed onto her beautiful kittens.

I have uploaded some photos but they really don’t do these kittens justice.. also these little monkeys don’t stay still long enough to get a good photo!

they are all extremely beautiful and extremely loving and affectionate. I would love for these kittens to go to five star homes please so only serious enquiries only please.
I would also love to stay in touch with their new Families which I have done so with all my previous litters , I love to see how they grow and seeing them loved in their new homes.

Please take a look at our social media account which you can find on Instagram - dociledollies_

Please take a look at the highlight ( mollys kittens ) to see all videos from birth up until
Recent of this beautiful litter.

Here you can also take a look at our previous litters their mum and dad and to also get a little insight of how loved and well cared for our cats and kittens are.

*kittens ready to leave end of November*

Thankyou very much for taking the time to read through my advert. I will look forward to hearing from you.
